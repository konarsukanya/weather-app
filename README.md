# weather-app
This is a weather app that allows users to check the weather for a specific location. I have utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build this app. The app fetches weather data from a public API and displays it to the user. We have a background image changes based on the weather conditions and a toggle for Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature units.
